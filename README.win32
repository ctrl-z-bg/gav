Welcome to GAV, a GPL rendition of the popular Arcade Volleyball.

Some of the menu items have not been implemented yet. Themes
support is there, but unaccessible if not from the code.

The keys are:
left player: z, c and left shift
right player: <-, -> and cursor up.

To activate a menu item, SPACE.
To exit from the game and go back to the menu, ESC
To switch to fullscreen (much faster), F10
