Welcome to GAV, a GPL rendition of the popular Arcade Volleyball.

Some menu items might not be implemtented yet.

Version 0.6.0 added:

- Theme support via the 'Extra' menu entry
  Only a silly modification of the classic theme is
  available so far, if you are interested in developing
  more, please do, and let us know!
- Keys redefinition works
- You can now activate menu items using the enter key (wow!)
- You can play more than one-a-side. Cooperative games are supported.
- Fullscreen can now be triggered via a menu entry

Keys:
default keys are:
Left player: z, c and left shift
Right player: left, right and up cursor keys.

use the arrow keys to navigate the menus, spacebar or enter to activate
items, F10 to switch to fullscreen mode while playing.

Checkout the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

Thanks:
- Marius Andreiana, who provided the gnome menu entry
- Mark Whittington, who provided patches to compile
  under Win32, and working on an installer.
